# Running t01-b

> Auto-generated starting point from what is in this branch. It is not a tested recipe; where it disagrees with the code, trust the code. The builder's own notes (`RESULT.md`, `DEVLOG.md`) are the primary source.

## 1. Stack and install

Detected: Node.js.

```sh
npm ci
```

Quip packages pinned: `@quip.network/hashsigs-wasm@0.2.1-rc9`. Several Quip packages publish their current API only under the `rc` dist-tag; check the pinned version before assuming `latest`.

## 2. How the builder ran it

From `RESULT.md` (section "How to run"), verbatim:

```bash
cd /private/tmp/devtrials2/t01-deepseek-v4-flash
npm install
npm run demo          # or: npx tsx src/demo.ts
```

- Node.js 18+ (tested on v22.22.2). No API keys, no network, no funds needed.
- Re-running regenerates a brand-new keypair each time.
- Output is also saved to `demo-output.log`.

npm scripts defined: `demo`

## 3. What you must supply

Key files, `.env` files and local secrets were **not** published (see `EXCLUDED.md`). Supply your own throwaway test accounts. Never use a mainnet account or real funds.

Nothing detected beyond a normal install. It may still need a funded account if it talks to a chain.

## 4. Networks it touches

- Solana devnet

Endpoints, faucets and chain parameters have changed over time. Take current values from <https://developers.quip.network/llms.txt> rather than from the code or notes here. Deployed contract addresses in the notes belong to the original run and may not exist anymore.

## 5. What was removed from this branch

- 1 x key material dir

Full list: `EXCLUDED.md`. If the project used a clone of a Quip repo (for example `nodes.quip.network`), clone it fresh from Quip.

## 6. If you use an AI agent to repair it

See `docs/AGENT_PROMPT.md` on the `main` branch. Give the agent this file, `TRIAL.md`, `RESULT.md` and `DEVLOG.md`.
