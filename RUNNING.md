# Running p1-a

> Auto-generated starting point from what is in this branch. It is not a tested recipe; where it disagrees with the code, trust the code. The builder's own notes (`RESULT.md`, `DEVLOG.md`) are the primary source.

## 1. Stack and install

Detected: Rust.

```sh
cargo build
```

Quip packages pinned: `hashsigs-rs "=0.2.1-rc9"`. Several Quip packages publish their current API only under the `rc` dist-tag; check the pinned version before assuming `latest`.

## 2. How the builder ran it

From `RESULT.md` (section "Run"), verbatim:

`cargo run --release` (Rust 1.95+, first build ~3 min). Creates a throwaway seed in `./keys/demo_seed.bin` (not printed).

## 3. What you must supply

Key files, `.env` files and local secrets were **not** published (see `EXCLUDED.md`). Supply your own throwaway test accounts. Never use a mainnet account or real funds.

Files the code expects (the format is whatever the reading script parses; open the script):

- `keys/demo_seed.bin`, read by `src/main.rs`

## 5. What was removed from this branch

- 1 x dependency/build/cache dir
- 1 x key material dir

Full list: `EXCLUDED.md`. If the project used a clone of a Quip repo (for example `nodes.quip.network`), clone it fresh from Quip.

## 6. If you use an AI agent to repair it

See `docs/AGENT_PROMPT.md` on the `main` branch. Give the agent this file, `TRIAL.md`, `RESULT.md` and `DEVLOG.md`.
